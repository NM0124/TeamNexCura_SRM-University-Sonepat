> **RESEARCH & SOFTWARE PROOF OF CONCEPT:** This system is an evidence-grounded research software prototype developed with synthetic time-series and synthetic EHR data. It does **not** provide medical diagnosis, does not prescribe treatments, and is not a cleared medical device.

---

## 1. Project Overview

The **Environment-Aware Asthma Digital Twin Platform** creates a dynamic virtual representation of an asthma patient by fusing static electronic health record (EHR) medical histories with continuous physiological measurements (PEF, SpO₂, heart rate, respiratory rate), patient-reported symptoms, and localized environmental exposures (PM2.5, PM10, pollen, temperature, humidity).

The platform continuously maintains a patient-specific personalized baseline, assesses incoming data quality, forecasts 6-hour deterioration risks, explains active environmental trigger fingerprints, and provides an interactive "what-if" scenario simulation lab for clinicians.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease affecting over 300 million people globally. Conventional clinical asthma care is predominantly episodic and reactive: patients visit clinics every few months, while sudden environmental surges (fine particulate air pollution, aeroallergens, abrupt weather shifts) trigger severe bronchospasms and acute exacerbations outside the clinic.

Existing remote patient monitoring systems present disconnected sensor graphs without context. They lack:
* Fused baseline awareness (distinguishing personal best from population averages).
* Predictive early warning (forecasting deterioration hours before severe symptoms).
* Environmental attribution (identifying which ambient exposures provoked the decline).
* Safe algorithmic abstention (preventing confident predictions on corrupted or stale sensor data).

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

The Environment-Aware Asthma Digital Twin addresses these shortcomings through:
1. **Longitudinal EHR Fusion:** Integrates Synthea FHIR records to ground the digital twin in the patient's verified diagnosis date, hospitalization history, active controller medications, and known allergies.
2. **Stepped Time-Series Replay Engine:** Replays hourly wearable and ambient environmental observations without leaking future observations.
3. **Personalized Robust Baseline:** Automatically computes rolling medians and MAD statistics, clearly flagging provisional baselines (< 24h) and maintaining clinician-documented clinical personal bests.
4. **Time-Aware Deterioration Prediction:** Estimates 6-hour risk of significant PEF decline ($< 80\%$ reference value) using only past observations.
5. **Personalized Trigger Fingerprint & Explainability:** Quantifies lag associations between particulate/pollen spikes and subsequent airway constriction.
6. **Scenario Simulation Lab ("What-If"):** Enables clinicians to simulate hypothetical exposure surges or medication interventions on an isolated clone of the twin.
7. **Safe Abstention & Quality Gate:** Explicitly withholds predictions when data are missing, out of physiological range, or stale.

---

## 4. Digital Twin Concept & Implementation

A **Digital Twin** in healthcare is a computational counterpart of an individual patient that mirrors their current state, updates dynamically as new observations arrive, and enables predictive forecasting and scenario simulation.

In this platform, each patient's twin is encapsulated as an independent `PatientTwin` entity:
* **State Isolation:** Observations for Patient A never alter Patient B's state or baselines.
* **Dual Time Awareness:** Maintains real-world observation timestamps strictly separated from simulated arrival timestamps.
* **Provisional vs. Established:** Baselines are marked provisional during the first 24 hours of data.
* **Idempotent Persistence:** All observations, predictions, and alerts are stored idempotently in a local SQLite database.

---

## 9. Demonstrating Primary Features

The doctor-facing dashboard provides an integrated, professional clinical workflow:
* **Anatomical Respiratory Visualizer:** 4 distinct sub-tabs (Lungs, Airways with lumen diameter dynamic scaling, CT Scan with DICOM study viewer, and 3D View with rotatable thoracic ribcage model).
* **Future-Event Prediction Card:** Displays 2-hour deterioration probability (e.g., 19% Low / 96% High), model confidence score, delta vs. previous observation, and top contributing feature bars.
* **Diagnostic Lab Reports:** Complete genuine panels (Eosinophils, Total IgE, CRP, Vitamin D, Serum IgA) with reference ranges and abnormal flags parsed from Synthea FHIR records.
* **Diagnostic CT Chest Viewer Modal:** High-resolution axial CT chest slices with window presets (Lung -600/1500 vs Mediastinal 40/400), slice navigation slider, orientation markers, and diagnostic radiology report.
* **Pulse Oximeter Module:** Interactive dual-mode interface (Mode A simulated BLE stream vs Mode B hardware Bluetooth SIG `0x1822` adapter standby), plethysmograph waveform, and clinical caution notes.
* **Innovation A: Personalized Environmental Trigger Fingerprint:** Multi-lag (30m, 1h, 2h, 6h) statistical correlation table with Indian urban air quality intelligence (Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad) with non-causal language.
* **Innovation B: Evidence-Traceable Prediction Audit Log:** Cutoff timestamps, immutable feature attributions, and post-horizon ground-truth outcome resolution (`Awaiting future observations`, `Event observed`, `Event not observed`).
* **Innovation C: Forecast Reliability Lab:** Honest 70/30 holdout comparison of 4 models (EHR-only, Dynamic-only, Fused, and Clinical Rule-Based) with sensor degradation stress tests.
* **Hypothetical Scenario Lab ("What-If"):** Non-destructive slider perturbations for PEF, PM2.5, pollen, and respiratory rate with instant in-silico counterfactual risk assessment.
* **Chronological Clinical Event Timeline:** Dedicated timeline page tracking environmental exposure spikes, respiratory deterioration, rescue medication actuations, and oximeter desaturations.
* **Clinician Feedback Review:** Audit capture interface allowing reviewing clinicians to evaluate, confirm, or annotate digital twin alerts.

---

## 10. Automated Test Suite

Run the full pytest suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

All 20 unit and integration tests validate:
* CSV loading, range checking, and duplicate timestamp handling.
* Step-by-step stream replay, seeking, and resetting.
* Synthea FHIR parsing and unrecorded clinical field preservation.
* Strict past-only feature extraction (no future leakage).
* Forward-looking label construction ($t_{\text{pred}} < t \le t_{\text{pred}} + 2\text{h}$) and safe abstention.
* Strict patient isolation and scenario non-mutation.
* Multi-patient generator seed reproducibility and bounded distributions.
* Multi-patient stream manager isolation and state synchronization.

---

## 11. Technical Deterioration Endpoint & Model Validation

* **Technical Adverse Event Endpoint:** At least 2 consecutive future readings within a 2-hour forward horizon where $\text{PEF} < 80\%$ of baseline reference.
* **Separation from Source Labels:** The source CSV column `synthetic_flareup_risk` reflects contemporaneous synthetic severity; it is excluded from model features and separated from forward deterioration targets.
* **Fair 70/30 Holdout Comparison:**
  * **Historical EHR Only (Logistic Regression):** F1: 0.000, PR-AUC: 0.028, Brier: 0.0251 (Baseline demographic anchor).
  * **Dynamic IoT Stream Only (HistGradientBoosting):** F1: 0.870, PR-AUC: 0.785, Brier: 0.0045 (Dynamic telemetry sensitivity).
  * **Fused Historical EHR + Dynamic Stream:** F1: 0.870, PR-AUC: 0.798, Brier: 0.0045 (Highest discriminative power).
  * **Clinical Rule-Based Baseline:** F1: 0.853, PR-AUC: N/A, Brier: N/A (Standard clinical threshold heuristic).
* **Degradation Stress Tests:** Safe abstention on corrupt data, graceful fallback on environmental dropout, and latency warnings on stale streams (> 4h).

## 12. Known Limitations & Clinical Boundary

1. **Synthetic Data:** The continuous wearable and environmental readings are generated mathematically; they do not capture complex in-vivo immunological inflammation.
2. **Prototype Boundary:** Evaluated on synthetic physiological cohorts; demonstrates mathematical and algorithmic software pipeline integrity, NOT cleared medical device efficacy.
3. **Association vs. Causation:** Trigger fingerprints strictly describe temporal statistical association, not clinical etiology or allergy diagnosis. Non-causal language is strictly maintained across all user interfaces.
4. **Non-Diagnostic:** Must not be used for autonomous drug adjustments or emergency triaging.
